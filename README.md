This repository contains a collection of example code and explanations for various algorithms and structures commonly used in 
artificial intelligence. Where appropriate, sources will be provided for exampe code pulled from other websites, but generally
much of the README files will contain expanded upon explanations and historical notations for what specific things do, and 
why they are done the way they are.
