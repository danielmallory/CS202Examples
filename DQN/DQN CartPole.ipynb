    "Now, let's define our model. But first, let's quickly recap what a DQN is.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DQN Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Our environment is deterministic (i.e. completely observable), so all equations presented here are also formulated deterministically for the sake of simplicity. In the reinforcement learning literature, they would also contain expectations over stochastic transitions in the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim will be to train a policy that tries to maximize the discounted, cumulative reward $R_{t_{0}}=\\sum_{t=t_0}^\\infty\\gamma^{t-t_0}r_t$ where $R_{t_0}$ is also known as the $\\textit{return}$. The discount parameter $\\gamma$ should be a constant between 0 and 1 that ensures the sum converges. It makes rewards from the uncertain far future less important for our agent than the ones in the near future that it can be fairly confident about.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea behind Q-learning is that if we had a function $Q^* : State\\times Action \\rightarrow R$ that could tell us what our return would be, if we were to take an action in a given state, then we could easily construct a policy that maximizes our rewards:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pi^*(s) = \\underset{a}{\\operatorname{argmax}}Q^*(s,a)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\pi$ specifies a probability distribution we attempt to maximize by taking the most optimal actions $\\textit{a}$ in a given state $\\textit{s}$, and $Q^*(s,a)$ denotes the true 'rewards' for the state action pair (s,a). Unfortuately, we generally don't have a perfect representation of the world (and by extension, never really have $Q^*(s,a)$); if we did, problems of reinforcement learning would be trivial - we could simply use our perfect knowledge of our surroundings to make the most optimal decision when in any state. Instead, much of reinforcement literature and books published involve algorithms for optimal action choice and search given the current knowledge of the state. Q-learning is learning based on estimation of our true rewards. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, since neural networks are $\\textit{extremely}$ good at approximating hyper-complex arbitrary functions for many given purposes (and, as it stands, they're $\\textit{so good}$ at it, we don't really understand how they are), we can just train a network to resemble our $Q^*$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our training update rule, we'll use the fact that every $Q$ function for some policy obeys the Bellman equation (Sutton et al. 1999):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q^\\pi(s,a)=r+\\gamma Q^\\pi(s',\\pi(s')) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're less interested in the mathematics behind it, just skip ahead. But if you want to delve deeper into Bellman equations and Markov Decision Processes (which underlie much of both discrete and continuous-time reinforcement learning), I'd recommend some of these: [1](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bams/1183519147), [2](https://joshgreaves.com/reinforcement-learning/understanding-rl-the-bellman-equations/), [3](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\delta=Q(s,a)-(r+\\gamma\\underset{a}{\\operatorname{max}Q(s',a))}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To minimize this error, we'll use the 'Huber loss' function. This is a loss function commonly used in regression analyses which is less sensitive to outliers in data (and thus early noisy estimates tend to throw it off less) than mean-squared error/loss. We will calculate this loss over a batch of transitions, rather than between individual transitions, since computationally, that would be rather expensive (and generally, most of machine learning involves things being trained on 'batches' to combat the time-consuming nature of their training). These will be sampled from replay memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}=\\frac{1}{|B|}\\sum_{(s,a,s',r)\\in B}\\mathcal{L}(\\delta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $$\\mathcal{L}(\\delta)=\n",
    "  \\begin{cases}\n",

    "                                   |\\delta|-\\frac{1}{2} & \\text{otherwise}\n",

    "\n",
    "## Q-Network\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model will be a [convolutional neural network](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) that takes in the difference between the current and previous screen patches. It has two outputs, representing $Q(\\theta$,left) and $Q(\\theta$,right) where $\\theta$ is the input network. In effect, the network is trying to predict the $\\textit{expected return}$ of taking each action given the current input."

It first samples a batch, concatenates all the tensors into a single one, computes $Q(s_t,a_t)$ and $V(s{t+1})=\\underset{a}{\\operatorname{max}}Q(s_{t+1},a)$, and combines them into our loss. By defition we set $V(s)=0$ if s is a terminal state. We also use a target network to compute $V(s_{t+1})$ for added stability. The target network has its weights kept frozen most of the time, but is updated with the policy network’s weights every so often. This is usually a set number of steps but we shall use episodes for simplicity."
